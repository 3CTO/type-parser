type-parser
================

This is a light weight library that does nothing but parse a string to a given type. 
Supports all applicable java classes, such as Integer, File, Enum, Float and also generic types as well, 
such as List&lt;Integer&gt;, Set&lt;File&gt; etc. Also possible to register your own parsers.
